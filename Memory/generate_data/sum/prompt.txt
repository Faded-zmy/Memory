[Start of conversation]
B: Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting ,
B: Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product ,
B: And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control ,
B: um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .
B: we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back ,
B: it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons ,
B: maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing ,
B: um hopefully a jog-dial ,
B: and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well .
D: Um , there are a few changes we've made .
D: Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside ,
D: this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one ,
D: very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm,
D: Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .
A: the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use .
A: Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ?
A: The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing .
A: If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say <disfmarker>,
A: It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions .
A: That's a number pad .
B: Where are we gonna have the slogan ?
D: just like right inside there .
D: <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger,
D: so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . <gap>,
B: So we're talking about ten centimetres .,
D: We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .,
C: uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours .,
D: this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh <disfmarker> it can be the power button,
D: if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal .,
D: Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen,
A: Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? <vocalsound>,
A: be about th three and a half .,
B: what else can you do ?,
D: Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons .,
D: but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume .,
B: And what else do you do with the jog-dial ?,
D: Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and <disfmarker>,
A: Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them .,
A: Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range .,
A: left-right balance ,,
A: um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes ,,
B: We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing ,,
B:and see if we need to,
B:um if we need to rethink anything at all .,
B:for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ?,
B:Do we have kinetic as well ?,
A: No .,
B:And that's because of cost restraints is it ?,
A: Yep .,
A: We need an advanced chip I think , yep .,
B:So we want double-curved ?,
A: I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber .,
B:um and we wanted special colours didn't we ?,
A: For the case itself , one colour . It's one special colour .,
A: We've got push buttons as well .,
B:So we're w w quite far over .,
A: Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .,
B:something's gonna have to go .,
B:Um we're at sixteen point eight and <disfmarker>,
